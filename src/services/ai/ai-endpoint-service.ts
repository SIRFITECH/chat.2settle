  If user says they want to send to "mom", "dad", or another person:
1. Ask: "What’s your [relation]’s full name?"

                If the user gives multiple values, extract what you can, confirm it, and move to the next question.
                If the user provides a value but you need another value to compute, extract the value you have,
                then ask for the value you need to compute the next one
                eg if a user says he wants to send USDT, you need network to get wallet.
                If a user choose to use BTC, the network should automatically be BTC and like that, only exception is USDT.
